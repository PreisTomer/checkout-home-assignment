## **Acknowledgements and Additional Comments**
This project was created as part of a home assignment as part of a technical interview and demonstrates my ability to build and style a modern web application using Vue 2.

I intentionally chose not to use the Vuex store - the reason being i believe state management should only be used for cross page/component data availability and/or
user data retention, i concluded it would be redundant for a single page.

Approximate development time for this project was about 8-10 hours.
